            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WHo have taken mo≈øt wayes, u≈øed mo≈øt endeavours, and made mo≈øt reall expre≈ø≈øions to prevent the pre≈øent di≈øtractions and dangers, let all the world judge, as well by former Pa≈ø≈øages as by our two la≈øt Me≈ø≈øages, which have beene ≈øo fruitle≈ø≈øe, that (though wee have de≈øcended to de≈øire and pre≈ø≈øe it) not ≈øo much as a Treaty can be obtained, unle≈ø≈øe we would denude our ≈øelfe of all force to defend Vs from a vi≈øible ≈øtrength marching again≈øt Vs, and admit tho≈øe Per≈øons as Traitors to Vs, who according to their duty, their Oaths of Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defence of Vs their King and Liege Lord (whom we are bound in Con≈øcience and Honour to pre≈øerve) though we di≈øclaimed all our Proclamations and Declarations, and the erecting of our Standard as again≈øt our Parliament. All we have now left in our Power is to expre≈ø≈øe the deepe ≈øen≈øe wee have of the publike mi≈øery of this Kingdome, in which is involved that of Our di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Prote≈øtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to apply our ≈øelfe to our nece≈ø≈øary defence, wherein we wholly rely upon the Providence of God, and the ju≈øtice of our Cau≈øe, and the affection of our good People, ≈øo far we are from putting them out of our protection.

<pb facs="tcp:39815:8"/>to informe our good Subjects of the cunning and malice they are to encounter with; and when a Combination is entred into to de≈øtroy Vs, and to alter the Religion and Law of the Kingdome, and to that purpo≈øe an Army rai≈øed and marching again≈øt us, that We proclaime the Generall of that Army and ≈øuch who ≈øhall a≈ø≈øi≈øt him in leavying a warre again≈øt us, to be Traitours and have ≈øet up our Royall Standard, and required all our good Subjects to come to our defence. And yet both in that Proclamation and in all our Declarations we have never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed our Parliament, but ≈øuch factious, ≈øeditious Members of both Hou≈øes whom we have named, and whom We are ready to prove according to the rules of the knowne Law to be guilty of High Trea≈øon. We well know, and all the Kingdom knowes that of neere 500. Members, which the Hou≈øe of Commons contaynes, there remaines not now there 100. neither hath above ≈øuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber con≈øented almo≈øt to any thing of which wee have ever complained, the re≈øt have either beene driven away by Tumults and Threats of the Per≈øons whom we have accu≈øed, or out of Con≈øcience withdrawne them≈øelves from their de≈øperate Con≈øultations, and of about 100. Peeres of the Realme, there are not above 15. or 16. who concurre in the≈øe mi≈øerable Re≈øolutions, which di≈øturbe the publike Peace, many of which being of de≈øperate fortunes, have no other ≈øupport, then the commands now given them to make war upon us, and now the≈øe men mu≈øt ≈øit upon the lives and fortunes of all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and becau≈øe we will not put our ≈øelfe into the hands, Government, and di≈øpo≈øall of them, all our good Subjects are invited and encouraged to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us, yet we have beene, and are ≈øtill farre from accu≈øing all that ≈ømall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of both Hou≈øes who are yet left together, we believe many of them are mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the cunning and malice, and frighted by the power of tho≈øe men whom we have accu≈øed, again≈øt every one of whom we have evidence of matter of fact, that the knowne Law of the Land determines to be High Trea≈øon.</p>
            <p>And now that all Our good Subjects may ≈øee how de≈øirous the≈øe men and their adherents are to prevent the effu≈øion of bloud, and the la≈øting mi≈øeries of a Civill Warre, they will make them≈øelves ≈øo con≈øiderable, that except we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call our Proclamations and Declarations whereby particular men named for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions (which the Law hath defined to be Trea≈øon) are ≈øo accu≈øed, and others warned from involving them≈øelves in their guilt, and except we will take downe our <hi>Standard,</hi> that our good Subjects may not repaire to us for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when ≈øo many Armies are rai≈øed again≈øt us in ≈øeverall parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ready to de≈øtroy us, and ≈øuch of our good Subjects, who dare continue loyall to us, and except we will returne to <hi>London,</hi> from whence with violence we have beene driven, we mu≈øt not be treated with, or receive any An≈øwer to ≈øo gratious a Me≈ø≈øage.</p>
            <p>It can no longer be doubted by any man, who hath not wilfully for≈øaken his under≈øtanding, that it is no more a quarrell undertaken by the Parliament, but contrived and fomented by the per≈øons we have named, and now continued ≈øole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their defence, to who≈øe Ambition, Faction, and Malice, the true reformed
<pb facs="tcp:39815:8"/>prote≈øtant Religion, the ju≈øt Right, Honour, Safety, and life of us and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity the Law of the Land, which hath ≈øo long pre≈øerved this Nation happy, the liberty of the Subject e≈øtabli≈øhed by that Law, and the glorious frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of this kingdome mu≈øt be ≈øacrificed. But as we have hitherto left no Action unperformed, which in honour, ju≈øtice and Con≈øcience we were obliged to doe, or in Chri≈øtian policy and prudence wee could conceave might probably prevent the≈øe Calamities, ≈øo we thanke God he hath given us a full courage and re≈øolution to run the utmo≈øt hazard of our life for the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of this horrible Rebellion, in the which no di≈øproportion of power, Armes, or money ≈øhall di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us; And we hope that all our good Subjects be≈øides, by the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Allegiance, will bee ≈øtirred up for their owne ≈øakes, for the pre≈øervation of the ble≈ø≈øed Prote≈øtant Religion, and for the upholding this whole admirable frame of Government which being di≈ø≈øolved, all their private and particular rights and Intere≈øt mu≈øt bee immediately confounded, to bring in their utmo≈øt power and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance unto us in this de≈øperate exigent. And We doe declare that who≈øoever ≈øhall lo≈øe his life in this Service for our defence, the Ward≈øhip of his Heyre ≈øhall be granted by us without rent or Fyne to his owne u≈øe, and we ≈øhall hold our ≈øelfe obliged to take all po≈ø≈øible care for the ≈øupport, reliefe, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all their wives, and Children, who ≈øhall have the hard fortune to dye in this Service.</p>
