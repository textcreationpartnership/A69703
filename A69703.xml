            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let them remember who have compelled us, and againſt our ſoules deſire, forced us to raiſe thoſe ſouldiers, and then if the oppreſſions and rapines were indeed ſuch as are falſely pretended, our poore Subjects who ſuffer under them, will looke on them, and only on them, as the Authors of all the miſeries they do or can undergo, we confeſſe with grief of heart ſome diſorders have, and many more may befall our good people by our ſouldiers, but we appeal to all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties through which we have paſſed, what care we have taken to prevent, and what Iuſtice we dayly inflict upon ſuch offendours: neither hath the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint been ever made to us of violences and outrages, which we have not to our utmoſt power repayred or puniſhed; how ever thoſe falſe &amp; treaſonable Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:39815:6"/>that they cauſe rather to offend us upon the confidence of pardon, then provoke thoſe Malignant perſons who without charity or companion deſtroy all who concurr not with them in faction and opinion. How farr we are from rapine and oppreſſion may appear by our Lenity to the perſons and Eſtates of thoſe who have not only exerciſed the <hi>Militia</hi> (the ſeed from whence this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt us hath growne) but contributed money and plate to the maintenance of that Army which now endeavours to deſtroy us, as of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Leiceſter,</hi> and many other places through which we have paſſed many of whom then were and now are in that Army: to let paſſe our paſſing by <hi>Chartly</hi> (the houſe of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) without other preſſures then as if he were the Generall of our owne Army, and our expreſſe orders to reſtraine the Liberty, our ſouldiers would otherwiſe have uſed upon that place, and his Eſtate about it.

By their declaring all perſons to be out of the protection of Parliament (and ſo expoſing them to the fury of their ſouldiers) who will not aſſiſt this rebellion againſt us, their anointed King, by the dayly outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> when contrary to the deſire and agreement of that County (ſigned under the hands of both partyes) they will not ſuffer the peace to be kept, but that the diſtractions and confuſion may be univerſall over the whole Kingdome, direct their Governour of <hi>Hull</hi> to make Warr upon our good Subjects in that County, and ſo continue the robbing and plundring the houſes of all ſuch who concurr not with them in this rebellion.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39815:7"/>
And for the priviledges of Parliament We have ſaid ſo much and upon ſuch reaſons, (which have never beene anſwered but by bare poſitive Aſſertions) in our ſeverall Declarations, that wee may well, and doe ſtill uſe the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, That we deſire God may ſo deale with Vs and our poſterity, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the preſervation of the juſt Rights of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The violation whereof in truth by theſe deſperate Perſons is ſo cleerely known to all men who underſtand the priviledges of Parliament, that their rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice hath not beene greater to Our Perſon and Government then to the Liberty, priviledge, and very being of Parliaments, witneſſe their putting imputting out, &amp; ſuſpending what perſons they pleaſe, as they dislike their opinions, their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cowne the Tumults to aſſault the Members, and awe the Parliament, their poſting and proſecuting ſuch Members of either Houſe as concurred not with them in their Deſignes, and ſo driving them from thence for the ſafety of their lives, their denying Vs, againſt the knowne, eſtabliſhed Law, and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdome, to have a negative voyce, without which no Parliament can conſiſt, their making cloſe Committees, from whence the Members of the Houſes are exempted, againſt the Liberty of Parliament, and laſtly reſolving both Houſes into a cloſe Committee, of ſeventeene perſons who undertake and direct all the preſent outrages and the managery of this Rebellion againſt Vs, in the abſence of foure parts of five of both Houſes, and without the privity of thoſe who ſtay there, which is not only contrary but deſtructive to Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By theſe groſſe, unheard of Invaſions and breaches of the Privledges of Parliament, (and without them they could not have done the other) They made way for their attempts upon the Law of the Land, and the introduction of that unlimited, Arbitrary power which they have ſince exerciſed to the intolerable da mage and confuſion of the whole kingdome, And We aſſure Our good Subjects the Vindication of theſe juſt Liberties and Priviledges of Parliament, thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by theſe men, is not leſſe the Argument of our preſent quarrell and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, then our owne Honour, Intereſt, and ſafety, thoſe being no way ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely to bee preſerved, as by preſerving Parliaments and their juſt Priviledges. Neither is there any Proteſtation to our knowledge publiſhed in our name of our tenderneſſe of the miſeries of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and our Reſolution to maintaine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Lawes of this Kingdome, that is not the Proteſtation of our Soule, and manifeſted in all our actions, and Wee hope that falſe Scandall, That diverſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Traitours and Rebels, the knowne favourers of them, and Agents for them are admitted to our preſence with favour and imployed in our ſervice, will gaine no credit with good men, who remember well the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious imputation ſo confidently and groundleſsly heretofore caſt on us by Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> of which as there could never be the leaſt proofe, ſo we could never receive any ſatisfaction for that high in jury, which might have beene a warning to them to have publiſhed no more ſuch untruths, if they had not found that truth and their Ends cannot meet together.</p>
            <p>For the Horſes taken for our Service, which were provided for the ſervice of
<pb facs="tcp:39815:7"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> It is true, Wee were compelled for the bringing our owne waggons from <hi>Chester</hi> for the Carriage of our Munition to make uſe of them being few in number and of ſmall value, after they were certified to bee of no uſe for the ſervice, for which they were provided. And for the Clothes, upon enquiry We find that ſome few were taken by our Souldiers (but without any order from Vs) going to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and as was probably believed for the reliefe of that place, then in actuall Rebellion againſt Vs, but how farre we have bin, and are from diverting any of thoſe proviſions made for the reliefe of that poore Kingdome (the thought of whoſe miſerable condition makes our heart bleed) may appeare by our expreſſe command given for the ſpeedy tranſportation of 3000. ſuites of Clothes which Wee found provided at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but neglected to bee ſent, and which no neceſſity of our owne Army here could prevaile with us to ſeize. And how bold ſoever the reproaches of that kind have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in upon Vs, we are confident malice it ſelfe cannot lay the leaſt probable imputation upon us, for the neglect of our duty towards that Kingdome. What one thing in our power have wee neglected or omitted, which might contribute to the aſſiſtance, or eaſe of our poore Proteſtant Subjects there? we firſt recommended the caſe of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to both our Houſes of Parliament. We conſented to all propoſitions made on the behalfe offered to raiſe 10000. Voluntiers, (which if then accepted had ſhortned that worke) offered to venture our owne perſon in the ſervice, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation that offer of ours found, is knowne to all the world, wee parted with our Intereſt in the Land of the Rebels, to encourage ſuch who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to adventure in that buſineſſe, and when Money is raiſed by our conſent for that ſole purpoſe, they have at once ſeized on a hundred thouſand pound parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly appointed by Act of Parliament for the reliefe of <hi>Jreland</hi> (our Army being ready to periſh for want of it) and imployed it to maintaine this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall civill Warre at home. They have Leavied men and entertained Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for that ſervice, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And no doubt theſe men (and theſe alone) by begetting this miſerable diſtraction of <hi>England,</hi> are guilty before God and Man of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable calamities that our Kingdome of <hi>Jreland</hi> endures. Let all the world judge where the deſire of peace is, and upon whoſe account the bloud and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion which hath beene ſhed and muſt follow, ſhall be caſt, And whether the ſeverall Proclamations and Declarations publiſhed by us, have not beene extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, by ſuch unheard of inſolencies and injuries, which no former times ever produced, neither can any ſober man wonder when Wee are publikely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, traduced, and reviled to our people (a practice never knowne till this Parliament) that We endeavour by a true relation and Declaration of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Intentions, and of their Conſpiracies, who have vowed our deſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:39815:8"/>to informe our good Subjects of the cunning and malice they are to encounter with; and when a Combination is entred into to deſtroy Vs, and to alter the Religion and Law of the Kingdome, and to that purpoſe an Army raiſed and marching againſt us, that We proclaime the Generall of that Army and ſuch who ſhall aſſiſt him in leavying a warre againſt us, to be Traitours and have ſet up our Royall Standard, and required all our good Subjects to come to our defence. And yet both in that Proclamation and in all our Declarations we have never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed our Parliament, but ſuch factious, ſeditious Members of both Houſes whom we have named, and whom We are ready to prove according to the rules of the knowne Law to be guilty of High Treaſon. We well know, and all the Kingdom knowes that of neere 500. Members, which the Houſe of Commons contaynes, there remaines not now there 100. neither hath above ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber conſented almoſt to any thing of which wee have ever complained, the reſt have either beene driven away by Tumults and Threats of the Perſons whom we have accuſed, or out of Conſcience withdrawne themſelves from their deſperate Conſultations, and of about 100. Peeres of the Realme, there are not above 15. or 16. who concurre in theſe miſerable Reſolutions, which diſturbe the publike Peace, many of which being of deſperate fortunes, have no other ſupport, then the commands now given them to make war upon us, and now theſe men muſt ſit upon the lives and fortunes of all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and becauſe we will not put our ſelfe into the hands, Government, and diſpoſall of them, all our good Subjects are invited and encouraged to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, yet we have beene, and are ſtill farre from accuſing all that ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of both Houſes who are yet left together, we believe many of them are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the cunning and malice, and frighted by the power of thoſe men whom we have accuſed, againſt every one of whom we have evidence of matter of fact, that the knowne Law of the Land determines to be High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>And now that all Our good Subjects may ſee how deſirous theſe men and their adherents are to prevent the effuſion of bloud, and the laſting miſeries of a Civill Warre, they will make themſelves ſo conſiderable, that except we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call our Proclamations and Declarations whereby particular men named for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions (which the Law hath defined to be Treaſon) are ſo accuſed, and others warned from involving themſelves in their guilt, and except we will take downe our <hi>Standard,</hi> that our good Subjects may not repaire to us for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when ſo many Armies are raiſed againſt us in ſeverall parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ready to deſtroy us, and ſuch of our good Subjects, who dare continue loyall to us, and except we will returne to <hi>London,</hi> from whence with violence we have beene driven, we muſt not be treated with, or receive any Anſwer to ſo gratious a Meſſage.</p>
            <p>It can no longer be doubted by any man, who hath not wilfully forſaken his underſtanding, that it is no more a quarrell undertaken by the Parliament, but contrived and fomented by the perſons we have named, and now continued ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their defence, to whoſe Ambition, Faction, and Malice, the true reformed

But as we have hitherto left no Action unperformed, which in honour, juſtice and Conſcience we were obliged to doe, or in Chriſtian policy and prudence wee could conceave might probably prevent theſe Calamities, ſo we thanke God he hath given us a full courage and reſolution to run the utmoſt hazard of our life for the ſuppreſſion of this horrible Rebellion, in the which no diſproportion of power, Armes, or money ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us; And we hope that all our good Subjects beſides, by the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Allegiance, will bee ſtirred up for their owne ſakes, for the preſervation of the bleſſed Proteſtant Religion, and for the upholding this whole admirable frame of Government which being diſſolved, all their private and particular rights and Intereſt muſt bee immediately confounded, to bring in their utmoſt power and aſſiſtance unto us in this deſperate exigent. And We doe declare that whoſoever ſhall loſe his life in this Service for our defence, the Wardſhip of his Heyre ſhall be granted by us without rent or Fyne to his owne uſe, and we ſhall hold our ſelfe obliged to take all poſſible care for the ſupport, reliefe, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all their wives, and Children, who ſhall have the hard fortune to dye in this Service.</p>
